Some revisions were not posted on CPAN; they were "internal"
 0.84_2		25/04/2005
 - test.t was bugged, again

 0.84_1		25/04/2005
 - test.t was bugged

 0.84		14/04/2005
 - No more complaining when you ask verbose absurdly high ( > levelmax)
 - Colors in log, if you want, and if your are not under MSWin
 - Splitting funny sentences from Log::Funlog's core to Log::Funlog::Lang.
   Long time since I wanted to do such a thing!
   So I can clean the directory from all the stuff laying around.
 - If Log::Funlog::Lang is not present and you don't ask for fun, it won't
 complain (so that you can use Log::Funlog in a production environment: it
 has no more fancy things in it that a customer could see.)

 0.83_2		08/03/2005
 - Complained that %ss was defined without 'caller' option even if you don't
 specify %ss
 
 0.83_1		17/02/2005
 - caller => 1 was bugged
 - Warn if %ss is specified and 'caller' was not, then assume caller => 1

 0.83		25/01/2005
 - README Updated
 - Speed improvement (I hope)
 - You can now say %d<-->d or %d-><-d or funny things like that (as long as it
 is somewhat symetric)
 - Clarity code improvement

 0.82		27/12/2004
 - Numbering change so that it conforms to perl usage, and you can say:
 	use Log::Funlog 0.82;
 - You can now say:
 	verbose => 'n/m',
 and n can be 'max'. What for? In case of n is an option of the command line,
 and you want the max debug level: you don't have to remember what is the max debug
 level, just say 'max' :)
